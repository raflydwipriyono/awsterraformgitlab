Welcome to my DevOps project vlog! I'm [Rafly Dwi Priyono](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raflydwipriyono/), and in this video, I will show you on how to set up a Terraform CI/CD pipeline using GitLab to automate AWS infrastructure deployment. 

We'll cover key DevOps best practices, including modules, variables, and S3 backends, to build a robust CI/CD pipeline.


<h2> This project is divided into two parts:</h2>

- <b> Terraform Setup</b>: Write and manually run Terraform code to ensure it works as expected.
- <b> CI/CD Automation</b>: Create a GitLab CI/CD pipeline to automate Terraform commands, so any changes in infrastructure—like scaling EC2 instances—are handled automatically.

Disclaimer: This project focuses on infrastructure setup rather than complete application deployment.
